# Stanford CS224N|Lecture 1-Introduction and Word Vectors
## Expectation of The Course

1
An understanding of the effective modern methods for deep learning
Basic first, then key methods used in NLP: Recurrent networks, attention, etc.
2
A big picture understanding of human languages and the difficulties in understanding and producing them.
3
An understanding of and ability to build systems (in PyTorch) for some of the major problems in NLP:
a.	Word meaning, dependency parsing, machine translation, question answering.
4
High-Level Plan for Problem Sets
a.	Homework 1 hopefully an easy on ramp â€“ an IPython Notebook
b.	Homework 2 is pure Python (numpy) but expects you to do
(multivariate) calculus so you really understand the basics
c.	Homework 3 introduces PyTorch
d.	Homework 4 and 5 use PyTorch on a GPU (Micorsoft Azure)
i.	Libraries like PyTorch, Tensorflow (and Chainer, MXNet, CNTK, Keras, etc.) are becoming the standard tools of Deep Learning
e.	For final project
i.	Do the default project, which is SQuAD question answering
1.	Open-ended but an easier start; a good choice for most
How do we represent the meaning of a Word?
Definition: meaning (Webster dictionary)
	the idea that is represented by a word, phrase, etc.
	the idea that a person wants to express by using words, signs, etc.
	the idea that is expressed in a work of writing, art, etc.
Commonest linguistic way of thin
